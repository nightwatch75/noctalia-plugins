# DNS Switcher

A [noctalia](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia) v5 bar plugin: switch the system DNS
between popular providers, your own servers, or the ISP default, from a panel on the bar. Based
on [Ronin-CK's v4 DNS Switcher](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/legacy-v4-plugins), rebuilt on
the v5 Luau plugin API.

## Plugin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ID | `nightwatch75/dns-switcher` |
| Entries | Bar widget: `dns-switcher`; panel: `panel`; service: `service` |

## Features

- **No-drop switching** — one `nmcli con mod` + `nmcli device reapply` on the active connection
  profile. The network never disconnects.
- **Pre-configured providers** (Google, Cloudflare, OpenDNS, AdGuard, Quad9) plus up to 5 custom
  servers (`Name = address`, e.g. `Pi-hole = 192.168.1.5`)
- **Real detection, not guessing** — reads the connection's own `ipv4.dns` /
  `ipv4.ignore-auto-dns`. A manually configured resolver (LAN ones included) shows as its
  provider; DHCP-assigned DNS shows as *Default (ISP)*.
- **DNS lookup tester** at the bottom of the panel — resolve a name with `dig`/`nslookup` through
  the active provider, or through any other provider via its row menu, without switching to it.
  Use it to confirm a switch, or to check whether a provider blocks a domain before switching.
- **Rebindable gestures** — left click, right click and scroll are declared in the manifest
  (`[widget.actions]`), so any of them can be remapped from the bar's own gesture settings.
- **Singleton service** — one engine regardless of how many bars/monitors show the widget; the
  widget and panel are pure renderers over its shared state.
- Live footer with the connection name and active resolver IPs, plus a copy button; glyph-only
  mode for compact bars.

## Usage

Add the `dns-switcher` widget from Noctalia's widget picker. Default gestures (remappable from
*Settings → Bar*):

| Action       | Effect                                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Left click   | Open/close the provider panel                     |
| Right click  | Reset to the connection default (ISP)             |
| Scroll       | Cycle to the next/previous configured provider    |

Right-click a provider row in the panel for its menu:

| Entry | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Apply this provider** | Same as a left click. On the active row it re-applies the profile. |
| **Copy these addresses** | Copies that provider's addresses to the clipboard. |
| **Look up *name* through this resolver** | Sends the hostname from the *DNS lookup* box to that provider only — does not change the system DNS. |

The lookup entry needs a valid hostname in the box and a provider with its own addresses; it's
disabled for *Default (ISP)*.

The panel and the plugin's settings page also open from the CLI:

```sh
noctalia msg panel-toggle nightwatch75/dns-switcher:panel
noctalia msg settings-open-plugin nightwatch75/dns-switcher
```

## Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `providers` | `string` | `google,cloudflare,opendns,adguard,quad9` | Comma-separated built-in provider ids shown in the panel. Empty = none. |
| `custom_1` … `custom_5` | `string` | *(empty)* | One custom resolver each: `Name = address`, one or two IPv4 addresses. |
| `poll_seconds` | `int` | `10` | How often the active DNS is re-read with `nmcli` (2–120). |
| `privilege_command` | `string` | *(empty)* | Prefix to run `nmcli` changes as root (`pkexec`, `sudo -n`) — see *Privileges*. |
| `show_label` (widget) | `bool` | `true` | Show the provider name next to the glyph. |

## IPC

```sh
noctalia msg plugin nightwatch75/dns-switcher:service all apply cloudflare
noctalia msg plugin nightwatch75/dns-switcher:service all poll
noctalia msg plugin nightwatch75/dns-switcher:service all cycle next
```

`apply` takes a built-in id, `default` (ISP), or `custom:<name>`; `poll` forces an immediate
re-check; `cycle next`/`cycle prev` step to the neighbouring provider (what scroll sends).

## Requirements

- noctalia v5.0.0-beta.9 or newer — the first release that accepts `plugin_api = 28`, needed for
  the provider row menu (`panel.openContextMenu`) and for argv process execution: every command
  the plugin runs is an argument vector, so no shell parses a DNS address, a hostname, or the
  privilege command. On beta.8 the plugin store keeps serving 0.1.2.
- NetworkManager (`networkmanager`, provides `nmcli`) with an active connection
- `env` (coreutils) — runs `nmcli` under `LC_ALL=C`
- Permission to modify system connections — see *Privileges* below
- `dig` (bind-tools/dnsutils) or `nslookup`, optional — only the lookup tester needs one of them;
  the rest of the plugin works without either

## Privileges

*Privilege command* is **empty by default**: NetworkManager's polkit policy usually lets active
local sessions modify system connections without a password. If you get a "not authorized" error,
set it to `pkexec` (shows noctalia's own polkit prompt) or `sudo -n` with a matching sudoers rule.

The privilege command is applied to the `nmcli con mod` and `nmcli device reapply` calls
individually, never to a wrapping shell, so the sudoers rule only ever needs to name `nmcli`
itself. It's split on whitespace into separate arguments (`sudo -n` is two); a privilege command
whose own path contains spaces isn't supported — use a wrapper script instead.

```
# /etc/sudoers.d/nmcli-dns
youruser ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/nmcli
```

With `pkexec`, this means an apply may show its polkit prompt twice (once per elevated `nmcli`
call) instead of once.

Or grant it via a polkit rule and keep the setting empty:

```js
// /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-nmcli-dns.rules
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
    if ((action.id == "org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.settings.modify.system" ||
         action.id == "org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.network-control") &&
        subject.isInGroup("wheel")) {
        return polkit.Result.YES;
    }
});
```

Both widen what the account can do to NetworkManager system-wide — apply your usual judgement on
shared machines.

## Notes

- IPv4 DNS only, like the v4 plugin.
- Targets the first active wifi/ethernet connection, falling back to the first active
  non-loopback one; a VPN's own DNS is not touched.
- Custom servers are five separate `string` settings rather than one list, because Noctalia's
  list editor has no in-place row edit — a `string` field does. A server name may not contain
  `=`.
